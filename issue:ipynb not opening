Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ALK8w81H7mi23tfeWqiwPqw98VB42iKl#scrollTo=2OuCNS22aoVW") there 
and then you get "https://nbviewer.org/github/VIVEK818713/Data-Cleaning/blob/main/Outliers.ipynb"
This site nbviewer works independently of github.
